    <h1>What I can do</h1>
    <p>Mostly anything related with technology. I love to work with anything that uses some kind of tech, old or new, and merge it with art. Well, I can also cook… ride a bicyicle, make gingerbread, drive a car, stay 50 seconds under the water, play videogames, make an animated bouncing ball, play the guitar, play drums, put on my own shoes.</p>
    <h3>Platforms</h3>
    <p>I don’t think the platform is very important as I can virtually work with any tech. I believe the result is the most important thing. Still, here are some applications that I can work with:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>— Games (PC/Mobile)</li>
       <li>— Web/Mobile</li>
       <li>— Applications</li>
       <li>— Installations</li>
       <li>— Softwares</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Can I do more?</h3>
    <p>If it is related to technology, I’m in! I love to learn and solve problems. As I always say: if it is worth it, then challenge accepted.</p>
